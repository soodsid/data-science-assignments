    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of a program by encapsulating data and behavior into objects. OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects to represent and manipulate data, rather than using functions or procedures. OOP is based on the concept of classes and objects, which are used to organize and structure code. By using OOP, developers can create modular, reusable, and scalable code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend."
