It requires less run time as compared to multiple inheritance due to less overhead 12.\n",

    "\n",
    "Public: Members of a class that are declared public are easily accessible from any part of the program. All data members and member functions of a class are public by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived from it. Data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore _ symbol before the data member of that class. Protected members of a class are accessible from within the class and are also available to its sub-classes. No other environment is permitted access to it. This enables specific resources of the parent class to be inherited by the child class.\n",

    "Private: Members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only. Private access modifier is the most secure access modifier. Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore __ symbol before the data member of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between protected and private access modifiers is that protected members can be accessed by the derived class, whereas private members cannot be accessed by the derived class. The difference between public and protected access modifiers is that protected members are not accessible outside the class hierarchy, whereas public members are accessible from anywhere in the program."
